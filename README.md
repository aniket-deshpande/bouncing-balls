# A simple physics simulation

### Here's my first real project in JS.
It simulates 100 balls bouncing with real gravity and friction

### Instructions
First: `git clone https://github.com/aniket-deshpande/bouncing-balls.git`
Second: `npm install` OR `yarn` (Both package managers work)
Third: `npm start` to run the webpack
